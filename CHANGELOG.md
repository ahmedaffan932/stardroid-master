## v1.0 [Mar 5, 2019]
###  Get countries of the world, and their flags as well as country codes
his release is provides a more intuitive interface for the user.  <br>

Major changes include:
1. Removal of ability of user to create a country in their app.
 In real world, countries are not created like that.

2.To get a country, a user has to know any of the four identifiers of the country
 - The country name eg Sweden
 - The country numeric code eg 752
 - The alpha2 of the country eg "se"
- The alpha3 of the country eg "swe"

With these, Sweden can be created alongside its flag using
```java
World.init(getApplicationContext()); 
// you call this just once in your program. It wraps a singleton 
// that initializes everything that the library is to offer
Country sweden = World.getCountryFrom("sweden"|"se"|"swe"|752); 
```
3. To get the flag of a country, the user needs any of the identifiers mensioned in 2 above, then using two methods
```java
World.init(getApplicationContext());
final int swedishFlag = World.getFlagOf("sweden"|"se"|"swe"|752);
```
4. If you are interested in all the countries of the world 
```java
World.init(getApplicationContext());
final List<Country> countries = World.getAllCountries(); 
// This list cannot be modified by adding, sorting or removing an element. 
// You can only retrieve information therein
```Â¨
NB: All Country identifiers have getters so you can use that to retrieve a Country
from `List<Country> countries`
```
Give a star to the repository to get updates of new features.

## v0.1.1 [Feb 29, 2020]
### Get country list with flags
